1. The function starts by checking if the input string `s` is empty. If it's empty, it returns 0 because there are no substrings to analyze.

2. Several helper functions are defined to encapsulate logic:
   - `charExists`: Checks if a character is in the character index Map.
   - `updateStart`: Updates the starting index of the current substring.
   - `updateCharIndexMap`: Updates the character's index in the Map.
   - `calculateMaxLength`: Calculates the maximum length of the current non-repeating substring.

3. The `reduce` function is used to process the characters in the input string `s`. It takes an initial state object as the second argument, which contains:
   - `maxLength`: Initialized to 0 to keep track of the maximum length of non-repeating substrings.
   - `start`: Initialized to 0 to store the start index of the current substring.
   - `charIndexMap`: Initialized as an empty Map to store character indices.
   - `end`: Initialized to 0 to represent the current end index.

4. The `reduce` function iterates over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it applies a pure function to update the state object. The state object is then returned and used as the new state for the next iteration.

5. In each iteration, the following happens:
   - `updatedStart` is calculated by calling the `updateStart` function with the current character, the character index Map, and the current start index.
   - `updatedCharIndexMap` is calculated by calling the `updateCharIndexMap` function with the current character, the character index Map, and the current end index.
   - `updatedMaxLength` is calculated by calling the `calculateMaxLength` function with the current end index and the updated start index.

6. The updated state object, including the new `maxLength`, `start`, `charIndexMap`, and `end`, is returned from each iteration.

7. Once all characters have been processed, the `reduce` function returns the final state object, which contains the `maxLength` of the longest non-repeating substring.
